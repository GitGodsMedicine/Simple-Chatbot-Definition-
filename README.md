# The code consists of three parts:

- The neural network implementation in assembly `rnn.asm`
- The knowledge file `knowledge.txt`
- The chatbot implementation in JavaScript `chatbot.mjs`

## Neural Network Implementation

The neural network is implemented using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN has an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer is the size of the input data, the hidden layer is 50 nodes, and the output layer is the size of the output data.

The RNN is trained using backpropagation. The backpropagation algorithm updates the weights and biases of the neural network to minimize the error between the actual output and the desired output.

## Knowledge File

The knowledge file is a text file that contains the knowledge that the chatbot will use to answer questions. The knowledge is organized into paragraphs, with each paragraph representing a single fact.

Chatbot Implementation

The chatbot implementation is written in JavaScript. The chatbot uses the neural network to answer questions. The chatbot first converts the question to a float64 array. The float64 array is then fed into the neural network. The neural network returns an output, which is then converted to a character. The character is the chatbot's response to the question.
